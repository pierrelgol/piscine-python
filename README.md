# piscine-python

This piscine is part of the 42 school's post common core cursus.

If you see comments everywhere please keep in mind that those are uterly and
completely useless, but the project requires that each fucking function 
come with a fucking bullshit comment like it wasn't fucking obvious what
a function like 'main' or 'isEven' does. Absolutely Moronic bullshit. But it is
what it is.
